    # Introducing traces

    After some time to explore logs, you may have a few questions about how to understand the complete architecture using only telemetry data.

    This section will introduce traces as a way to understand how the pieces of the architecture interact with each other.

ðŸ‘€ A new tab!
===================

You can see that there is a new tab added to the right hand side called `ðŸ”— Traces`.

This tab is a running [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) instance. Jaeger is an open source distributed tracing application.


ðŸ‘£ Exploring Jaeger traces
==========================

In Jaeger you can look for a specific trace using the search bar at the top, or you can browse traces by adding filters on the left.

Since you do not have a specific trace ID to search for yet, you should start by trying to find a specific action that you take in the UI.

For example, try and find the trace where you imported or added a new Pokemon.

How about a trace where you created an error?

> ðŸ’¡ If you didn't create an error yet, try using a number over 1010 for import


ðŸ•¸ The web of services involved in a single action
==================================================

If you found your action as a trace, you can likely see that this single action actually required a number of different services and sub actions.

Each green bar (or row) indicates a sub action. In the case of import, there are both database and streaming requests made.


ðŸ”™ Let's go back to logs as well
================================

While we have introduced tracing as a way to solve the challenge of viewing requests across time and across services, it is helpful to compare this to our old (and the more common) way of doing this in logs to really feel the difference.

ðŸ—£ Let's chat
=============

1. How did traces help you understand the application?
1. What information was most helpful about the traces?
1. What is the place for logs in a world with tracing?
