    # Using expressions and selectors for more powerful test cases

    One of the concerns with the tests so far is how tied to the single test trigger they are. This tight coupling can create fragile tests that we don't need any more of.

    In this section we will look at how to write more matcher based selectors and assertions to make your tests more flexible.

üòë What are expressions?
========================

Expressions aren't just something a person's face shows. They are also a way to write small bits of logic to result in an answer. For example, an `if` statement is an expression that results in `true` or `false` as an answer.

The full documentation on TraceTest expressions can be found here: https://docs.tracetest.io/concepts/expressions/

üßÆ Calculating response time
============================

One way to use expressions is to set a more flexible response assertion.

For example, try writing a test that checks for response time but sets a limit of acceptable response time rather than a specific value.

üìù Selecting spans
==================

Selectors are the logic for deciding what parts of a Trace the assertions should run against. You may want something to be true for all spans (e.g. no errors) while wanting something else to be only true for one or a few spans (e.g. a specific value found in only one service).

The full documentation on TraceTest selectors can be found here: https://docs.tracetest.io/concepts/selectors

üïµüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Selecting spans
==================

Spans can be particularly useful for reducing duplicated test cases.

Try and use the built in helpers to select current and all spans, but also try and work with the expression to select only a few of the spans that you may want to validate against.

üé¨ This is the end, unless you want a big challenge
===================================================

Like any tool, there is a lot to learn. With the topics we have covered so far you can easily spend the rest of the day or even week honing your understanding and skills.

Thinking about logs, traces, and testing traces are big topics.

But if you really want to cram it all in, go ahead to the next section where we introduce test suites with data passing between steps ‚ú®
