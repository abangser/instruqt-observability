    # Creating a test to validate (and maintain) your trace data

    Given we think this trace data gives a great view of the entire system, it seems reasonable to want to use this to also _validate_ the entire system!

    In addition, while telemetry data is in code, it has a lot of the same properties as comments. In that it may be close to the code, but the chance to drift or "rot" is high. Using the data as a part of high value test suites can help maintain the quality and freshness of the telemetry data.

üëÄ Another new tab
==================

In this section you again have a new tab added to the right hand side. It is called `üîó Testing`.

This tab is a running [TraceTest](https://tracetest.io/) instance. TraceTest is an OSS tool that allows you to write validations against trace data.

TraceTest can act independently as a test runner (i.e. actually executing the user flow test case) and a validator (i.e. making assertions against the data collected).

While TraceTest can validate against externally created traces, today we will use TraceTest to write our user flow _and_ do the validation of the resulting trace data.

üó∫ First a tour
===============

This instance of TraceTest actually already has some data in it which can give you a sense of how it works.

Try and complete the following challenges to understand how it works:
1. Change one of the tests so that it will fail. Then re-run the test and see if fail.
1. Find the TraceID from one of the tests and investigate the same trace in Jaeger vs in TraceTest

üÜï Writing your first test
===========================

On the introductory slide it was mentioned that TraceTest can be a runner and a validator, but can also separate and only do validation on previously created data.

Since the two concepts can be separated in TraceTest we are going to focus first on how to write `tests` by creating a test from an existing trace.

üïµüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Find your self a trace to test
=================================

To test a specific trace, you will need to first go get a `traceID` from Jaeger on the `üîó Traces` tab.

Go ahead an search for a trace that depicts something interesting to you. When you find one, select it from the list so that you are in the detailed view.

This detailed view is called the `Trace Timeline` view. You can change the view from the rop right corner where there is a drop down button. Select this button and click on `Trace JSON`. This will open a new tab but give you access to the complete `traceID`.

Copy this `traceID` field and return to the `üîó Testing` Instruqt tab.

üß™ Create a TraceTest
=====================

In the top right corner of the TraceTest home page, select `Create`. This will present you with a number of options including `TraceID`. Select this option.

Provide a name and description of your choosing and then hit `Next`.

Name your variable name the same as what was in the JSON so `traceID` and

> üêõ Watch out! Small bug here here you need to actually `x` out of the front test modal to get to the variable modal!

In the variable modal, paste the TraceID from the the previous step.

Then hit `Run`.

This should bring up the runner page. If you navigate to the `Trace` tab you should be able to compare this to the trace you had selected in Jaeger!

But this hasn't validated anything yet so go on to the next header...


ü¶æ First, try a template test
=============================

Navigate over to the `Test` tab and you should continue to see the trace on your left, but now a blank work area to the right. At the top of this work area you can click the down arrow (üîΩ) next to `Add Test Spec` and select one of the snippets.

This will automatically populate a test and immediately run it for you. This is great, but it is not tailored to your request nor is it enough validation. Time to add a second (this time custom) validation.

‚òë Now add a custom test
======================

There are two ways to add custom validations and you should try both!

1Ô∏è‚É£ First:

You can use the `Add Test Spec` button to create one from an empty form. TraceTest will automatically select the root span for you, but why don't you try and select a different span, and then add an assertion to it.

> üí° Tip: If you aren't sure what to assert on, you may want to use the attributes panel on the left to explore options. You can open this with the double chevron (‚è©).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Second:

Once within the attributes tab you can actually select the three dots next to an attribute and have an option to `Create a test spec`.

Try making a few assertions and seeing what attributes you would want to assert on.

‚úÖ Well done on your first test!
================================

While this is exciting, it is likely more effective to see how TraceTest can work with or even replace some of your API or End-to-End testing by working with triggers. Go ahead and move onto the next section to check that out!
