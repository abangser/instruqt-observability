    # Using trace data for good (and maintaining it!)

    Given we think this trace data gives a great view of the entire system, it seems reasonable to want to use this to also _validate_ the entire system!

    In addition, while telemetry data is in code, it has a lot of the same properties as comments. In that it may be close to the code, but the chance to drift or "rot" is high. Using the data as a part of high value test suites can help maintain the quality and freshness of the telemetry data.

ðŸ‘€ Another new tab
==================

In this section you again have a new tab added to the right hand side. It is called `ðŸ”— Testing`.

This tab is a running [TraceTest](https://tracetest.io/) instance. TraceTest is an OSS tool that allows you to write validations against trace data.

TraceTest can act independently as a test runner (i.e. actually executing the user flow test case) and a validator (i.e. making assertions against the data collected).

While TraceTest can validate against externally created traces, today we will use TraceTest to write our user flow _and_ do the validation of the resulting trace data.

ðŸ—º First a tour
