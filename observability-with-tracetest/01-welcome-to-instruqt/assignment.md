ü§ñ First, where am I?
=====================

This first section is an introduction to your workshop environment here in Instruqt.

Instruqt is a completely browser based environment where you will be able to explore and experiment in a safe way without needing to change your personal computers in any way.


üóÇ Other views
==============

Each section will have a number of exposed tabs. These tabs give you access to the tools and views that you need only for the task at hand.

These tabs can be viewed at the top of the webpage. For example, this task has two tabs:

1. Pokeshop Webapp
2. Editor

Try switching between the two views.

You will notice that the editor view is a real live VSCode style editor. So as you can see, you can have really powerful interactions despite being in a browser!


ü™ê Making more space
====================

Sometimes you will need instructions, other times you will want more space to work. If you ever want to minimize these instructions you can click the `` icon and then use the `` icon to re-open them when you need them again.


‚è≠ Moving on up
===============

When you are done with a section you are welcome to hit the green button and move onto the next instructions. While there is nothing destructive that occurs between sections, you may want to hold off moving forward until you feel you have fully explored and completed the current section as you can't go backwards!

üôå That's it!
=============

That is enough learning about the course, now it's time to do what we came here for...Observability!

Go ahead and click the green "Check" button and move to the next section.
